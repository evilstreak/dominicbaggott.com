    <h1>Hi!<br>
    I’m <strong>Dominic Baggott</strong>, a London-based client-side web developer.<br>
    I craft sites from standards-based code with a focus on usability.</h1>

    <div id="availability">
      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>I am not available for work.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I am highly skilled in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know my way
    around Photoshop and can use it to produce designs and mock-ups when
    required. I apply my knowledge of usability and user behaviour to all my
    interface work. On the back-end I can knock out PHP with ease, write Java
    fluently, and read Perl. In addition to my technical skills, I have
    experience project-managing webapp development using Trac and Basecamp.</p>

        <p>As well as project-managing the development of this webapp I was in
        charge of designing the user experience and writing the front-end
        code.</p>

        <p>I designed and implemented this brochure-site for a holiday home in
        the south of France, working with the owner to establish how best to
        present their content.</p>

        <p>The final project I worked on at Icom was the redesign for this
        career and education site aimed at 14–24 year olds. Unfortunately the
        site is no longer active.</p>

    <p>If you need my skills on your project and want to discuss it, or you'd
    like a copy of my CV, please send me an email at
    <a href="mailto:dominic.baggott@gmail.com">dominic.baggott@gmail.com</a>.
    I can work from my own office or yours, depending on your location and
    setup.</p>

          Your Preferences

              <img src="images/yourpreferences/test.png" height="465" width="620" alt="">
              <h3>The Test</h3>
              <p>At the core of the app is a psychometric test to establish what
              your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types">type
              preferences</a> are. Originally developed for people with
              learning disabilities, the test is based around choosing several
              images from pairs of options.</p>
              <p>As it turns out, this image-based approach was well received
              by many more people than the intended audience thanks to its low
              barrier to involvement and the sense of fun brought by images
              rather than the traditional long questions.</p>
              <p>In order to keep the tool accessible but build on the ease of
              use we started with a basic, functional version of the test using
              only HTML forms. We then used JavaScript to make it run more
              smoothly by preloading images and using <abbr
              title="XMLHttpRequest">XHR</abbr> to report choices back to the
              server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/yourpreferences/pdf.png" height="465" width="620" alt="">
              <h3>Generated PDFs</h3>
              <p>To allow people to easily save, email and print their reports
              we generate both an online HTML version, and a downloadable PDF
              version with the option to have it emailed to you.</p>
              <p>Two interesting constraints that arose from these dual-format
              reports were the need for multiple source images — one small
              bitmap image for the HTML report, and one large bitmap or vector
              image for the PDF report — and the need to have the branding and
              styling of the reports feel similar, whilst also playing to the
              strengths of the medium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/yourpreferences/admin.png" height="465" width="620" alt="">
              <h3>Admin Interface</h3>
              <p>The app uses a two-tier admin system for inviting and managing
              people, teams and companies, and editing and creating reports.
              Since the second tier admin functions (managing the creation and
              permissions of people and teams) are available to companies using
              the system they must be robust and easy to use.</p>
              <p>I used a drag-drop interface for managing the permissions for
              each report. This concept is reused across all the forms where
              permissions are set: creating, inviting and editing of people,
              groups and companies.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="iportfolio">
        <h2>i-Portfolio</h2>
        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
          <ul class="project-detail">
            <li>
              <img src="images/iportfolio/test.png" height="465" width="620" alt="">
              <h3>Toolkit Tests</h3>
              <p>One of the unique features of the site was a set of four tests
              which, combined with a detailed set of criteria and values for
              700+ jobs, allowed us to make useful suggestions about careers
              which may interest you.</p>
              <p>The tests needed to be accessible, so I created them in a
              basic state as large HTML forms. Using JavaScript I then created
              a "front" to the form, providing an intuitive interface making
              the tests a lot more fun.</p>
              <p>In order to make code maintenance easier, I kept as much
              shared functionality from the four tests as I could in a single
              object, extending it to work with the specifics of each case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/iportfolio/skins.png" height="465" width="620" alt="">
              <h3>Skinning</h3>
              <p>This site was built in association with several education
              organisations, such as UCAS, City &amp; Guilds and learndirect.
              Some of these organisations had skinned versions of the site
              available on a subdomain for users directed into the system from
              their online tools.</p> <p>In order to keep the impact of
              skinning on maintenance and development effort as low as possible
              we designed and built the site with a strict definition of what
              skinning could alter. The end result was a site which carried the
              logo and brand colours of the partner, yet still had the high
              quality user experience we had designed for.</p>
