    <h1>Hi!<br>
    Iâ€™m <strong>Dominic Baggott</strong>, a London-based full-stack web developer.<br>
    I craft sites from standards-based code with a focus on usability.</h1>

    <div id="availability">
      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>I am available from September 2013.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I am highly skilled in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know my way
    around Photoshop and can use it to produce designs and mock-ups when
    required. I apply my knowledge of usability and user behaviour to all my
    interface work.</p>

    <p>On the back-end I can build Ruby apps from the ground up and knock out
    PHP with ease. I can configure servers and databases for development and
    production.</p>

    <p>If you need my skills on your project and want to discuss it, or you'd
    like a copy of my CV, please send me an email at
    <a href="mailto:dominic.baggott@gmail.com">dominic.baggott@gmail.com</a>.
    I can work from my own office or yours, depending on your location and
    setup.</p>
