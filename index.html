<h1>Hi!<br>
I’m <span>Dominic Baggott</span>, a UK-based technologist.<br>
I help companies improve their software, improve their teams and improve their
businesses.</h1>

<p>I have over 15 years’ experience developing software and leading teams for a
wide variety of clients: NHS, GOV.UK, Marks &amp; Spencer, Lloyds TSB and
Channel 5, as well as many smaller companies and startups.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dom is a rare find. Not only is he an incredibly talented and efficient
  developer who delivers exceptional work and guidance but he’s a level head
  and true pleasure to work with. I would be excited to work with him
  again.</p>
  <cite>– Paul Joyce, CEO at Geckoboard</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>I can get hands-on with your Ruby, JavaScript or PHP project to help your
team ship a great product.</p>

<p>I can coach your team to deliver great work, whether they need support with
technical skills, architecture, or process.</p>

<p>And when I say I can do these things, it's because I've been doing them for
my other clients for over a decade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I led the technical team at DigiResults to build an affiliate sales
    network that processed $3.8M of sales.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Dom’s grasp of the big picture was one of our best assets at
      DigiResults. He understood that in start-up companies, everything’s
      connected. And that meant when I gave Dom a problem, I knew it wasn’t
      just going to lead to more work for me further down the line. When Dom
      took on a problem, that problem just went away.</p>
      <cite>– Andy Fletcher, CEO &amp; co-founder at DigiResults</cite>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I rebuilt the video-on-demand rendering infrastructure for Viddyoze and
    trained a new distributed development team to run the service, improving
    performance and stability and cutting their AWS bill from £30,000 to £8,000
    per month.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I led development across two teams at GOV.UK to prepare the site for
    over 300 government organisations to be transitioned to the single
    domain.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Dom is one of our most experienced, excellent and generally empathetic
      lead developers.</p>
      <cite>– Tom Loosemore, Deputy Director at UK Government Digital Service</cite>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I’ve hired people for engineering, technical operations, and customer
    support, providing line management, pastoral care and technical leadership
    for them.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I’ve coached and developed junior staff into great engineers, fostered
    internal engineering communities, and run a graduate engineering
    scheme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
